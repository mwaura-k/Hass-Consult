## Context


# Define the question
We will be working for Hass Consulting Company, a real estate firm. The goal is to determine the factors that may affect housing prices; information that was gathered over the previous months. 
Also, we are to create a model that would allow the company to accurately predict the sale of prices upon being provided with the predictor variables.

# Experimental Design

Load the dataset and study it.

Perform data cleaning.

Check for anomalies, outliers and missing values and deal with them.

Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis and record the observations.

Performing regression analysis. Here we will perform modelling using several regression techniques like;

      Multiple Linear Regression
      
      Quantile Regression
      
      Ridge Regression
      
      Lasso Regression
      
      Elastic Net Regression
      
Evaluate the performance of the models and give recommendation on the suitability of each of the tested models on their appropriateness of solving the given problem.

Check for multicollinearity

Create residual plots for the models, and assess heteroskedasticity using Barlett's test.

Challenge your solution by providing insights and giving recommendations.
